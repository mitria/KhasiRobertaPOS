Download the pretrained Khasi language model from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15P1B5TlPIaqUZDJEE43GkOm7V9QS-rXV?usp=drive_link)<br>  

Download the trained RoPOS(Roberta for KhasiPOS tagging) model from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vhgPVqFsmZjWxHuk_wepwqiRnb4OTki2?usp=sharing)<br>  
* To train the Language model, open the KhasiRobLM.ipynb notebook and run the cells <br>

* Create a CheckPoint directory for saving checkpoints while training and a BestModel directory for saving the best model <br>

* The embeddings can be extracted from this pretrained model for use in POS tagging task <br>  

Open Ropos.ipynb and follow the steps :<br>   

* to train, prepare the training and validation dataset<br>   

* to test, prepare the test dataset  as indicated in the comments in the notebook<br>   

* to inference, use an untagged Khasi text file , and run the cell for inferencing<br>
